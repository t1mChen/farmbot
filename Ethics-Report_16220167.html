                    <p>Ethics Report</p><p>Under the context of our team there are several ethics issue that may happen at some point during the progress. In this report, three possible ethical issues will be discussed mainly. The possible reasons that may trigger the issue, how the issue may impact the team and the project, the strategies to avoid these issues, and / or remedies after the happen of the issues will also be proposed.</p><p>Since out projectâ€™s mission is to contribute towards a relatively large open-source project, the confirmation of consistency in feature development must me be maintained to meet the standard requirements from the client. Therefore, transparency of codes being written must be maintained during the development process before the actual handover towards the client. Hence, our team has developed code standards for developers to follow to avoid conflicts. However, in any team of development, someone may accidentally not follow the provided standards or write codes that cannot be understood by other developers. Especially, when one or many feature is needed to be implemented following and based on the completion of another foundational functions. (For example, in our program, the development of images mapping and photos management requires access to same set of pictures created by the team, hence the code must be transparent enough so that following developers are able to understand and integrate from this point). This may greatly impact the approval of the project, which can lead to delay or deny by client. To solve this issue, we must hold code review sessions after specific feature development to ensure that all codes are in consistent format using a reasonable optimization. Also, someone should be responsible to ensure that the code written is relevant and not intentionally breaking other functions or perform malicious activities. And these are the activities that we used to maintain transparency of code. </p><p>Another ethical issue that may arise is conflictive personal interests. Sometimes, due to different personal beliefs and judgements, team members may act conflictive and not willing to contribute to certain parts of the program or result in personal bias for certain algorithms. This issue may arise anytime within the team. It might result in unexpected delay in delivering the project due to slower combined progress. To avoid the existence of this issue, tasks should be split into sub tasks that is modular enough so that the developer is not able to inject personal interest or bias into the feature. Also, clear communication and negotiation must be ensured so that any concerns are being proposed as early as possible, so that the allocation of roles can be switched or adjusted for the benefit of the team as well as the project not to be highly impacted or delayed. If the issue happens, the problem can be identified during integration test or unit test by the QA team. Then, based upon the result, the problems can be resolved with further clarification in discussion with the team members. We have hosted frequent meetings when any concerns are raised by team members to ensure clear communication and equal understanding, hence there was no conflict happened.</p><p>The last ethical issue that might happen is the data privacy problem. In our project, we need to include photos or pictures to represent the growing process of the plants in the demo programs. The sources of the images, which might not be properly sources, and hence may lead to privacy issues if the photos are not authorized. So, end users may see these photos which might contain private information. Generally, if an IT team is required to build functions involves external data or resources, it might result in leak of privacy if it is being delivered at the end. Therefore, to ensure that this issue never arises, every team member must credit where the resource is gathered, and whether the photo is authorized to use. In our team, we have come up with creative idea of taking original photos by ourselves since we have access to FarmBot devices. And we have gained authorization from the taker of the photo within our team. Hence, no privacy issue happened.</p><p>  </p>
