                    <p>We decided to use Google Cloud Platform as our cloud infrastructure provider as it is a reliable that platform offers a range of services, including virtual machines, for hosting applications and services. We added a public key to the Google Cloud Platform account for SSH authentication when connecting to your VM instances. Initially, we only created a single virtual machine (VM) to host the Farmbot  application as the VM was configured to run the necessary software. However, we encountered performance and connectivity issues, specifically slow access and frequent disconnections when attempting parallel access with multiple devices to the Farmbot application hosted on the single VM. To address the performance and connectivity issues, we decided to scale the infrastructure by creating a separate VM on each device for each of our members to access to the Farmbot application. This can help distribute the load and improve performance especially when  dealing with multiple concurrent connections. </p><p>However, these changes also introduced some administrative challenges. We had to reset new private and public keys for VM, set up new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instances, and redo the deployment process multiple times to accommodate this as there were still connectivity issues. </p>
