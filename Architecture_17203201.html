So a component tree with hierarchy can help us better understand the structure of UI than a domain model with only entities and relationships but no hierarchy.</p><p><strong>Sequence diagram</strong>:</p><p>Sequence diagram can visually show the interactions between potential users and the FarmBot system as well as the interactions inside the system, which allows developers and stakeholders to understand how a specific task is accomplished by different elements within the system.</p><p><strong>Component diagram</strong>:</p><p>Component diagram represents how different parts of FarmBot system are organised together, providing a high-level view of the system's architecture.</p><p><strong>Document changes</strong>:</p><p>Since we are introducing new features into the existing application, it is important for us to track which files we will modify and which components we will add so that we can understand how newly built features work and how they integrate into the current system.</p><p><strong>Database model</strong>:</p><p>Database model is not relevant since we don&rsquo;t use database in this project.</p><p><strong>Deployment diagram</strong>:</p><p>We are not using CICD so we do not have an auto deployment workflow. All the deployment are done manually. Therefore, a deployment diagram is not relevant.</p><p><strong>Coding standard</strong>:</p><p>In order for us to understand each other&rsquo;s code and collaborate with each other more easily, we determine the coding standards to follow.</p><p /><p><strong><span data-colorid="z42iawl2dh">9.01</span></strong></p><p>Use component tree to document changes as each node in component tree corresponds to a .tsx file in codebase. This implies that when we modify or add files, we can make notations on the corresponding nodes. So it will be more straightforward to track the changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
