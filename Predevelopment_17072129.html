This decision of contributing to open source project is more high achieving and more meaningful than other options. Though it requires more process to analyse the exising code base.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="n23iq1loop">8.18</span></strong></p><h4 id="Predevelopment-Taskallocations:">Task allocations:</h4><p>Since this is a project that is most relative to front-end development (simulating a FarmBot), we have decided to organise the team structure as 3 front-end developer and one backend developer to support this project.</p><h4 id="Predevelopment-Workenvironment:">Work environment:</h4><p>We have decided to host one virtual machine for everyone to join. The benefit of this setting is we can possibly run multiple servers of the web app locally in the VM, so everyone should have access development process under the same environment</p><h4 id="Predevelopment-UIdesign:">UI design:</h4><p>As of now, the features we intend to add will have no impact on the current layout of the web app's UI. So, the UI design is not relevant at the moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="lv9petc2tn">8.23</span></strong></p><p>We have separated our three epics as outlined in the user stories using the paired programming strategy. That is, for each of epic 1 and 2, camera and movement, we have allocated two group members to maintain and develop the functions. This is the decision due to scale of each task to be achieved. Also, one person to manage the webcam feature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="gc2lgm32rf">8.25</span></strong></p><p><strong>Work environment</strong>:</p><p>Unlike before, we have decided to host virtual machine individually for each person. This is due to our initial environement failed when we attempt to host multiple farmbot web apps in parallel, and the host crashed. Under this new development set up, we are able to develop under same environment, without impacting other changes currently under progress.</p><p><strong>User stories</strong>:</p><p>We have decided that these three Epics that we currently have are Must Have features. Since in a demo web app, we want to attract the potential users to try the core or essentials features that can dramatically improve their life by purchasing the devices.</p><p>We will add more user stories to ensure that the overall scope is suitable for the duration of entire development phase, and also for the client&rsquo;s interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="rzm3edkqcs">8.27</span></strong></p><h3 id="Predevelopment-Addcommunicationdiagram:">Add communication diagram:</h3><p>Despite having various tools at our disposal to aid in teamwork and the agile process, we still experience some inefficiencies in collaboration. To resolve this issue, our team decides to use RACI matrix to document roles each person will play in different tasks. With this method, everyone involved can understand their responsibilities and the responsibilities of others and know the person to turn to when encountering problems, which prevent confusion and greatly promote collaboration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="Predevelopment-Addnewfeatures:">Add new features:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Tour Guide feature</strong>: we find that the current tour guide lacks sufficient clarity, so we decide to modify it to make it more clear. This is a should have requirement since a good tour guide can improve users experience as well as maximise the value that users can derive from the app, increasing the likelihood of them to buy a product.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support multiple models</strong>: we decide to make the demo support multiple models so that user can compare characteristics and limitations of them. This is a could have feature since it might be technically complex.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advertisement</strong>: System can pop up farmbot ads to users. However, this feature might disrupt the user's browsing, making them unsatisfied. So we label this as could have.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feedback System</strong>: Client can see feedback from the web app. This is a won&rsquo;t have requirement with the lowest priority since it is not essential to achieve the core objective of the project.</p></li></ul><p /><p /><p><strong><span data-colorid="mgg6leq8w9">9.20</span></strong></p><p><strong>Deployment &amp; Handover:</strong></p><p>Deployment:</p><p>unlike in a traditional project, we&rsquo;re contributing and developing new features and functions towards an open source project. Hence we should follow the provided development standards by Farmbot official documents and github page.</p><p>Therefore, we have decided to deploy our service using strategy of IaaS using Goggle Compute Engine. This effectively starts a virtual machine instance running the ubuntu system, which is the correct method as acknowledged by the official Farmbot Web App development github.</p><p>With this deployment strategy, we can develop function that can be easily adapted towards the original development file.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Handover:</strong></p><p>For our scope of project, our ultimate handover would just be a pull request from the staging branch towards the original github of Farmbot Web App.</p><p>To manage our handover, we will develop a table of contents, including all relevant files and artifects, a changelog to record the functions that has been added to the existing system. Also, a readme file would also be essential for the client&rsquo;s benefit in understanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Details of handover will be confirmed soon as we approaching the handover stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communication matrix</strong></p><p>Decided to add communication matrix to <a href="Members_4980805.html" data-linked-resource-id="4980805" data-linked-resource-version="26" data-linked-resource-type="page">Members</a> :</p><p>Clearly defining task assignments among team members, ensuring prompt issue resolution during the production process, and maintaining project transparency.</p><p>Establish a team communication plan that specifies when and how team meetings, updates, and progress reports will occur.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="a81eli7ifc">9.22</span></strong></p><p><strong>Front end design:</strong></p><p>In the previous phase, we initially considered frontend design as not relevant. However, as the project progressed and based on client feedback, we have come to the realization that incorporating advertising and a tour guide in the Farmbot demo is indeed essential. Consequently, we have made the decision to undertake frontend design for these two new features.</p><p>A well-designed frontend enhances the overall user experience, making it easier and more enjoyable for users to interact with your application or website. This leads to better usability, reducing the learning curve for users and increasing their efficiency when using your product.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="y99uyvmo8a">9.24</span></strong></p><p><strong>Changelog</strong></p><p>Through week8 lecture, we decided to add a changelog, it can ensure:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Changelogs offer transparency to users, customers, and team members by providing insight into what has been altered or improved in a project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> They serve as a form of documentation, helping developers and stakeholders understand the history of a project's development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bug Tracking:</strong> Changelogs help track and identify specific changes related to bug fixes, which can aid in troubleshooting and quality assurance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> They facilitate collaboration within development teams by keeping everyone informed about changes and progress.</p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
