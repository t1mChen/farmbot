Treat it as an open platform for you to create your own project.<br/>2. Sure, you can certainly do so, and you can aim to end up with a<strong> pull request </strong>to close this issue.<br/>3. Yes, you can interact with a real farm.bot. They are located on the last level in the student precinct, the building that has a pho restaurant. <strong>You can access them anytime</strong>. If you are interested, We can set up a time to meet there so I can show you around, but feel free to go and explore it. There are currently other teams working with them, but no-one needs exclusive access. You'll most likely need to setup a <strong>local server </strong>to develop and test your changes. Check this page for more info: <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://developer.farm.bot/v15/docs/farmbot-software-development" rel="nofollow">https://developer.farm.bot/v15/docs/farmbot-software-development</a>  and <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://developer.farm.bot/v15/docs/web-app/frontend" rel="nofollow">https://developer.farm.bot/v15/docs/web-app/frontend</a> <br/>4. If you build a Dashboard, I'll focus on an <strong>API that monitors changes</strong> on a target csv file for the e-nose, and for the thermal camera, assume that you monitor images in a folder, as different cameras have different standards. For the e-nose, Talking with the colleagues from Agriculture, they mentioned that it would be great to <strong>automatically recognise when the signal is in the &quot;statble state&quot;</strong>. They mention that this happens after x seconds of <strong>holding the e-nose still over a plant</strong>, and then the sensors signal has a <strong>bell-curve shape</strong>. You could design a dashboard that <strong>loads the data and automatically recognizes the calibrated regions of the time series</strong>. They will send me the data soon, the team is currently in Europe, coming back on the <em>28th of Aug</em>. If you are interested in building a ML pipeline, take a look if you can use <em>datasets from Kaggle that contain ground truth data</em>. You can certainly find datasets for FLIR cameras, but you may want to explore other datasets in the agricultural or plant space.<br/>5- Absolutly!</p>
