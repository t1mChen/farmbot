FarmBot is a device that is available for the general public to purchase. It&rsquo;s aim is to create a scientific observation, such that the user is able to grow their vegetables in their backyards with assist from the information collected. Without being specifically expertise in agricultural field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a sample image that demonstrates the process. The FarmBot device can be controlled by the user via the Web Application. The App will provide user perceptions from the device, including camera, the position of the device, the conditions of the plants, whether the user should water the garden based on weather conditions etc., and execute a level of automated steps such as water the garden when predetermined by user.</p><p>The FarmBot demo interface is basically enabling user to access web app with a trial account, that enables the user to experience the features that they could have after own and maintain an actual FarmBot device.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there&rsquo;s a fair level of feature that user can experience such as design the garden. However, when under demo interface, users will receive message like this most of the times. Which is quite disruptive to the user experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our investigation of the App the core interactive features such as taking photos and check history photos on either map or live cam, moving farmbot to detect soil height and weed. Which means that the users may most likely to be distracted when facing this notification all the time.</p><p>Also, the lack of UE and lack of influence on user is another key reason that user may not want or not even consider at all to purchase a device. Which is possibly not what the client willing to see. But we don&rsquo;t really know where client is anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why our mission to tackle this is essentially problem?&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>$6421 which saves you almost 1.5k</p><p>Seems like a great deal isn&rsquo;t it</p><p>some of you may think 6k is not that expensive right for such an innovative and time-saving product, which i believe most of you probably may no think so.&nbsp;</p><p>However it is only the standalone fee, and labeled in USD. So you still have to pay import tax, exchange rate etc..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So how the hell I&rsquo;m willing to spend 14 or 15k on a device like this which I&rsquo;m not knowing its feature and impact on me at all. Which is a ridiculous question. Get customers to interest in this program would be the key to solve this issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore our mission is to provide a simulated environment letting users to experience the benefits of obtaining a device. That is, simulate the core features of the app, and on top of that, adding new features to influence the users to be attracted by the app and potentially to make their decisions on actually purchasing one.</p><p /><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="712020:47456e71-02a0-4c64-89ee-2ce0cde002bf" href="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:47456e71-02a0-4c64-89ee-2ce0cde002bf?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="65537" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki">Jiahao Shi</a> <strong><span data-colorid="ygdf6kkwku">Demo demonstration  </span></strong></p><p>Ok, let's see what this farmbot can do.<br />Here is the tour guide, good. (click click) Oh, I can see the photos of the plants. You haven't taken any photos yet, alright lets take some photos.<br />Unavailable in demo accounts, but how shou I know how it works and what it will look like. (click click)<br />Oh, I can move the robot on the website? that is cool. lets try to move it. Unavailable again?<br />What does this webcam tab do. Why are thet all photos? shouldn't it be webcams?<br />Why is everything unavailable. Does it even really work? Should I buy it, I am not sure.</p><p>We believe that the coolest features of Farmbot are the ability to remotely monitor the condition of your plants, allowing you to witness the process of their growth.<br />And you can control the robot online so you can keep your farm  taken care of.<br />When using the original demo's photo section, both features were not supported. That's why we decided to make a change. And here is our new Farmbot Web App. And here is our new FarmBot Web App.</p><p>Ok, let's see what this farmbot can do.<br />Oh you can see your plants on the map? I did not expect this, this is so cool! and you can see them in the album, nice. And with this time filter, you can actually see how the plants grewï¼Ÿ I think I am getting emotionally attached to these plants.<br />Let's see what does the movement tab do. I can see how the robot is moving on my map? I always wanted to control a robot.<br />And the webcam tab, ohhh, so it is a surveillance cam. I can now see if there is racoon stilling my carrots. But why is the surveillance cam showing a irrelevant place, the development team must have ran into a webcam source difficulty because they did not have a farmbot or a webcam so they used a open source webcam stream.<br />But with this demo, I can clearly see how the farmbot works. And as a farm hobbiest and a robot lover, I should definitely but this!<br /></p><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="712020:ab9f0a10-be1b-47cc-abc3-27ec2f73d083" href="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:ab9f0a10-be1b-47cc-abc3-27ec2f73d083?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="1245185" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki">Xinxin Guo</a> <strong><span data-colorid="wmpcwpowwl">Progress</span></strong></p><p>Base on those purposes, our project begins with a set of requirements, we have two main section with functional requirements, unlock unavailable function from original system and add varies new functionalities to attract users. For each sections, we separated that again into three epics, we will elaborate this part more later. All of these requirements collectively contribute to a common ultimate goal, which is to make the user feels FarmBot system is highly advanced, helpful, and user-friendly. This also indicates our emphasis on Usability and User Experience in the non-functional requirements. Ensuring that all other requirements can be met, we have additionally incorporated user experience testing to guarantee the fulfillment of this requirement.</p><p>This is our choice of tools to make make our team more efficient and productive.</p><p>In our Agile project management approach, we derive three sprints to build the system, with each of those we have planning and retrospective to make sure everything on track.</p><p>With everything ready, lets have a look on our new system.</p><p /><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="712020:ab9f0a10-be1b-47cc-abc3-27ec2f73d083" href="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:ab9f0a10-be1b-47cc-abc3-27ec2f73d083?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="1245185" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki">Xinxin Guo</a> <strong><span data-colorid="o6o7xehysm">Challenges + overcome</span></strong></p><p>Here are challenges when we build up our features and how we overcome them.</p><p>Firstly, communication, especially internal communication, the challenge lies in not just speaking but in actively listening and understanding each other. We hold regular meetings to ensure face to face communication and document every decisions and progresses to ensure everyone up to date. The common issue among our project is clients may not fully grasp the project details, and provide feedback in time. To have better communication with client, we send a copy of summarized project proposal and ask question for details in slack.</p><p>The existed codebase have more than a thousand files included and 12k commitments, with this find ourselves tasked in such a exploit codebases can be super complex. This are all farmbot files, and u can see it is time consuming to find the one we need. We need to read through the develop documentation and fully understand the original code before making any changes. To help team members understanding the codebase and their task, we hold meeting for code inspection and included a communication diagram to visualizing communication, each group member is responsible for a section, can solve related issues involving in that section. As well we build detailed github branching standard, making sure every changes are clear and understandable.</p><p /><p>Moreover, when writing automated test code, we need to recreate the environment that the program encounters during actual operation. This often involves handling many props and states, with the code frequently scattered across various files. Moreover, these files might contain additional related functions, even small changes may lead to unpredictable serious side effects when employing mocking features of testing frameworks like Jest.We inspected the domain and codebase together to find solution, and leverage various auxiliary tools in IDE.</p><p /><p>Lastly, we also met obstacles while we setting up virtual environment using GCP. Initially, we only created a single virtual machine (VM) to host the Farmbot application as the VM was configured to run the necessary software. However, we encountered performance and connectivity issues, like slow access and frequent disconnections when attempting parallel access. In this case, we decided to create separate VM for each group members to improve performance especially when dealing with multiple concurrent connections. Even with the right VM seting, we had to reset new private and public keys, set up new GCP instances, and redo the deployment process multiple times to accommodate this as there were still connectivity issues.</p><p /><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="712020:e7d1836a-1f69-47d2-82b3-afdefe09d411" href="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:e7d1836a-1f69-47d2-82b3-afdefe09d411?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="950286" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki">Mingyu Li</a> <strong><span data-colorid="sg92g364ql">Lessons</span></strong></p><p>Lessons!! So, the most valuable lesson we learnt is how to work as a team in an agile way. And the first thing we need is to communicate effectively.</p><p>&ldquo;Effective communication&rdquo; here means it should be clear and precise about what progress has been made, what decisions are taken, what goals are set, and after communication, all team members are clear about the current progress of the project and know their respective responsibilities. &nbsp;</p><p>By doing so, we can ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards one common goal, which can significantly improve the collaboration and problem solving.</p><p>But communication only is apparently not enough because there might be information loss and different people can interpret the information differently during communication, which means that inconsistency, confusion is produced. That is why we need documentation.</p><p>A professional documentation should accurately record all relevant information about the current progress and should be updated frequently to ensure the consistency. And a standard to check if a documentation is good or not is whether it can be understood by someone new to the project. </p><p>So, A good documentation ensures that all team members share a common understanding of the project&rsquo;s components, requirements, and goals, no confusion is caused, and save a lot of energy from communication.</p><p>And, with the communication and documentation, we can come up with a model for our agile development. It is quite similar to the observer pattern. The subject here is common understanding of the project with each member of the team sticking to it. Once someone made a progress, they will update their progress through communication and record it in documentation. And everyone else update their knowledge and adapt if necessary. </p><p>With this model, people can understand how the agile development work and how to join it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another lesson we learnt is how to modify and extend functionalities on an existing open-source project.</p><p>So, to extend features, the first thing is to understand the application. Our FarmBot Web App is a Redux React application with TypeScript. In such an application, there is a single source of truth called Local store, and we store the states of all components in it. So, if we need to update data, there is single place we have to update. And all components of UI will be immediately notified to reflect the changes.</p><p>However, to realise the demo account features, we cannot modify the current system directly because it is a bad practice and will cause some security concerns. So, to avoid it, we simulate a local store and let all components listen to it if it is in demo mode. With this method, we successfully implement all features without influencing the original functionalities.</p><p /><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="712020:64bc5406-0c49-4bd4-9777-8dee2ffb8d20" href="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki/people/712020:64bc5406-0c49-4bd4-9777-8dee2ffb8d20?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="950285" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://jiahaoshi.atlassian.net/wiki">Sugon Christjaroon</a> <strong><span data-colorid="us36vy2ug9">Achievements</span></strong></p><p>Achievements!! One of our team&rsquo;s achievements is forking and building on a large existing codebase. As previously mentioned in the challenges, it wasn't just about writing new code; it required us to delve deep into the intricacies of the pre-existing system. This process entailed a meticulous analysis of the documentation of FarmBot. We had to unravel the complexities of the existing architecture, an arduous but necessary task to extend the system seamlessly.</p><p>Another one of our achievements is the fact that we were able to successfully implement both new and variant features. As shown in the demonstration and introduction, we added both new features and unlocked features that were not available in the demo such as time lapse and photo movement as explained previously. </p><p>As a result we were able to significantly improve the user experience of the farmbot demo. We've transformed the FarmBot demo into a platform that is both engaging and user-friendly. Users can now explore the full range of features with ease, navigate the website effortlessly, and enjoy a far more immersive experience than what the previous version offered.</p><p>One of our most profound accomplishments goes beyond coding and innovation. It's the experience of translating our academic knowledge into real-world impact. We finally did something different in university. We contributed to an open source project, a simulation of a real-world job. This hands-on experience served as a valuable lesson, equipping us with skills, insights, and a deep appreciation for the collaborative, real-world nature of modern projects.</p><p>FarmBot has made substantial contributions to agriculture by introducing precision farming, sustainable practices, and data-driven decision-making. Its open-source approach has democratized advanced farming technology, promoting education and research, while also aiding in adapting to climate change, ultimately benefiting both small-scale and large-scale farming operations.</p><p /><p />
